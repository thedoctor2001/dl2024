Tutorial

Requisite: 
- Install numpy to run :( (My only working implementation, the implementation without numpy is so buggy :( )
- Run main.py (don't forget to put other python files and the data folder in the same place) is enough :D
- You can run my Buggy_version.ipynb on Colab (a version without numpy, but it might be buggy with bad coding quality T.T)
