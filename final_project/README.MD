Tutorial

Requisite: 
- Install numpy to run :( (My only working implementation, the implementation without numpy is so buggy :( )

How to run:
- Run main.py (don't forget to put other python files and the data folder in the same place) is enough :D
- You can run my Buggy_version.ipynb on Colab (a version without numpy, but it might be buggy with bad coding quality T.T)
- For the C version if you are interested :D (as I asked you before if I use C for the project - but I'm not sure as this C version has a high accuracy rate which might be suspicious). Just compile and run the main.c in the c_version folder is enough (don't forget to put the data files besides). Have fun to read the code if you want, but I advise you not to read ^_^
